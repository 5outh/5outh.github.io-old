<p>Like with any programming project, certain aspects of generating artwork can become repetitive or difficult over time. I want to discuss some infrastructure/tooling related utilities that I’ve built around my art generation process to make it easier to work with. This post is language-agnostic in the sense that these ideas should be portable between different stacks. Example code is presented in Haskell and zsh, but I aim to explain these concepts well enough that the code doesn’t matter all that much.</p>
<h3 id="rendering-new-images-on-any-source-change">Rendering new images on any source change</h3>
<p>When I make a change in a file, I expect to see the result of that change as soon as possible, without doing anything extra. That is a philosophy I stand by in all of my programming work, for the most part:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code should re-compile when it changes</li>
<li>Any relevant tests should re-run when code changes (if I am currently testing)</li>
<li>A new image should be rendered when sketch source code changes</li>
</ul>
<p>One language-agnostic tool for achieving this file-watching capability is <a href="http://www.entrproject.org/">entr</a>. There are other file watchers out there, but this one has been reliable for me. Given a program <code>generate-art</code> that generates a new image, it can be used like this:</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>$ ls &lt;source files&gt; | entr generate-art</code></pre>
<p><code>&lt;source files&gt;</code> for me is <code>**/*.hs</code> in <code>zsh</code> - all Haskell files in the current directory. When any of those files are changed, a new image is re-rendered.</p>
<h3 id="organizing-images">Organizing images</h3>
<p>…but, we don’t just want one image. It’s much better to have a snapshot of <strong>every single image that has ever been rendered</strong> so we can pick and choose our favorites and look back at how far we’ve come. We must organize.</p>
<p>My image organization technique is super simple. I store images in the following directory heirarchy: <code>images/&lt;name&gt;/&lt;seed&gt;.png</code>, where</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is the name of the piece I am currently working on. This is often something nebulous like <code>sketch4</code> while I’m messing around. Once a process starts to take shape, I change the name to something more concrete.</li>
<li><code>&lt;seed&gt;</code> is a UNIX Timestamp. When developing sketches, the current UNIX Timestamp is used as a seed, so a natural linear order is established within each folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, a single file <code>latest.png</code> is created and overwritten on save in each folder. This allows me to leave <code>latest.png</code> open in an (auto-reloading) image viewer, and see any changes automatically.</p>
<h3 id="controlling-variables">Controlling variables</h3>
<p>My art generation program has a thin CLI wrapper which I use to control certain variables. Here’s the help text as an overview:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>$ drawing-hs --help
drawing-hs

Usage: drawing-hs [--seed SEED] [--scale SCALE] [--width WIDTH]
                  [--height HEIGHT] [--times TIMES] [--name NAME]
                  [-r|--render-progress] [-v|--render-video]
                  [--metadata METADATA]
  Generate art

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text</code></pre>
<p>This is tremendously useful and not particularly difficult behavior to achieve. Here are some example scenarios that have made this absolutely invaluable:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I am generating a process that is kind of chaotic, but I like some of the outputs a lot. I turn on the flag <code>--times=100</code> to render 100 random images instead of just one.</p>
<hr width="11%" />
<p><br /></p>
<p>I am working on a piece that is kind of slow to render, especially with a large image size. I turn down the flag <code>--scale=10</code> to <code>--scale=5</code> to speed up the rendering until I am happier with the process.</p>
<hr width="11%" />
<p><br /></p>
<p>I have generated hundreds of images and have picked out one that I like a lot. I can set the seed using the <code>--seed</code> flag, along with a large scale using the <code>--scale</code> flag to generate the large version for printing.</p>
<hr width="11%" />
<p><br /></p>
<p>I have found a particular seed I like a lot, but don’t really like the color palette I was using. I can set the <code>--seed</code> flag to lock the seed and tweak non-random components of the program (in this instance, the color palette).</p>
<hr width="11%" />
<p><br /></p>
<p>I have decided that my <code>sketch</code> is good enough to be named. I pass in the <code>--name</code> flag to start saving my files in a new location for polishing and better organization.</p>
<hr width="11%" />
<p>Extremely useful stuff. We’ll talk about <code>--render-progress</code> and <code>--render-video</code> later.</p>
<h3 id="recovering-lost-sketches">Recovering lost sketches</h3>
<p>Here’s a short story. One day, I was iterating on a process and posted a work in progress image to twitter. <a href="http://www.tylerlhobbs.com">Tyler Hobbs</a> expressed interest in a print swap with that work-in-progress image. Hell yeah, I thought! Sounds awesome.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I had iterated on that particular sketch a bit after posting. The original image I had posted was not large enough to print, and I had no way of pairing up the seed used to generate the image with the code that actually generated it. I was able to recover it mostly, but the colors were not quite the same as the image I posted on twitter, and it took a ton of effort to even partially recover it. This really bothered me. Ultimately, we still swapped prints, which was a wonderful experience. But I knew I had to fix the problem of unrecoverable works in progress.</p>

<i>The infamous unrecoverable sketch</i>
</center>
<p>Here’s what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a completely new git repository in a separate location. I call it <code>sketch</code>.</li>
<li>Whenever the program runs, copy the source code from the “real” drawing project to the <code>sketch</code> folder.</li>
<li>Automatically create a git commit with the name of the <code>seed</code> in it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is implemented as a hook that runs after each image is generated. The script <code>save_sketch</code> looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">#! /bin/zsh</span>

<span class="co"># Copy all source files to the sketch directory, overwriting anything that's</span>
<span class="co"># already there</span>
<span class="kw">cp</span> -R src/ ../sketch
<span class="kw">cd</span> ../sketch

<span class="co"># Create a git commit with the provided message, allowing empty commits in case</span>
<span class="co"># no code was actually changed (allowing the reference of multiple sketches from</span>
<span class="co"># the same code, with different seeds)</span>
<span class="kw">git</span> add . -A
<span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">$1</span><span class="st">&quot;</span> --allow-empty</code></pre></div>
<p>And in my Haskell code, I have this little function that runs as a part of the image generation process:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">saveSketch ::</span> <span class="dt">Generate</span> ()
saveSketch <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
  seed <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> asks worldSeed
  liftIO <span class="fu">$</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
    (code, out, _) <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> readProcessWithExitCode
      <span class="st">&quot;./scripts/save_sketch.sh&quot;</span>
      [<span class="st">&quot;Automated publish; Seed: &quot;</span> <span class="fu">&lt;&gt;</span> show seed]
      <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>
    putStrLn <span class="fu">$</span> show code <span class="fu">&lt;&gt;</span> <span class="st">&quot; // &quot;</span> <span class="fu">&lt;&gt;</span> out</code></pre></div>
<p>For readers not fluent in Haskell, this basically means “get the current seed and call <code>./scripts.save_sketch.sh</code> with a commit message containing it”.</p>
<p>Now, recovering sketches is just a matter of reaching into that repository and copying it to the working directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode zsh"><code class="sourceCode zsh"><span class="co">#! /bin/zsh</span>

<span class="co"># Make sure we want to override the current source tree, since this is a</span>
<span class="co"># destructive operation</span>
<span class="kw">read</span> -q <span class="st">&quot;RELOAD?Are you sure you want to restore history to (</span><span class="ot">$1</span><span class="st">)? &quot;</span> -n 1 -r
<span class="kw">echo</span>

<span class="kw">if [[</span> <span class="ot">$RELOAD</span> =~ ^[Yy]$<span class="kw"> ]]</span>
<span class="kw">then</span>
  <span class="kw">cd</span> ../sketch

  <span class="co"># Check out the git hash with the matching seed in &quot;sketch&quot; repository,</span>
  <span class="co"># then copy it over to the &quot;real&quot; repository destructively. Afterwards,</span>
  <span class="co"># switch back to the `master` branch of the &quot;sketch&quot; repository.</span>
  <span class="ot">COMMIT_HASH=$(</span>git --no-pager <span class="kw">log</span> --grep <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">$1</span><span class="st">&quot;</span> --pretty=format:<span class="st">&quot;%h&quot;</span><span class="ot">)</span>
  git checkout <span class="ot">$COMMIT_HASH</span>

  <span class="kw">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;Overwriting drawing-hs source...&quot;</span>
  <span class="kw">cp</span> -R src ../drawing-hs/src/

  <span class="kw">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;Resetting to master branch...&quot;</span>
  git checkout master
<span class="kw">else</span>
  <span class="kw">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;Aborting due to negative confirmation.&quot;</span>
<span class="kw">fi</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This has not only been useful for situations like the print swap, but also for iterative work. Sometimes, I go too far in one direction, look back and realize I liked a previous iteration better. These scripts allow me to reset my progress back to any previous state, which has the additional psychological side-effect of pushing my work forward without fear of loss.</p>
<h3 id="rendering-video">Rendering video</h3>
<p>My graphics framework doesn’t allow native creation of videos. Instead, I render a bunch of intermediate images with a specified format, then pass those into <code>ffmpeg</code> to create an mp4. To do this, a few things are needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A global counter, to track the frame number that is currently being rendered</li>
<li>A way of formatting ints with a specific amount of padding (I use 8 digits)</li>
<li>ffmpeg, of course</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a utility function called <code>renderProgress</code> that renders a single png with the surface that is currently being drawn. I can litter my program with calls to <code>renderProgress</code> - often in loops - to render a given frame with the appropriate index. This stores images in the folder <code>./images/&lt;name&gt;/progress/&lt;seed&gt;/&lt;index&gt;.png</code>, where <code>&lt;index&gt;</code> is a frame index, padded with 8s to 8 digits. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l images/example_sketch/progress/1539455256091/
total 72464

# ... and so on</code></pre>
<p>Progress is only rendered if the <code>--render-progress</code> CLI flag is turned on; this allows me to conditionally turn off intermediate rendering (which is slow) without having to manually remove a bunch of function calls from my program.</p>
<p>In order to turn these frames into a video, I use a little wrapper around <code>ffmpeg</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">#! /bin/zsh</span>

<span class="co"># Arguments:</span>
<span class="co"># $1: name of the sketch</span>
<span class="co"># $2: seed of the sketch</span>
<span class="co"># $3: desired frame rate</span>

<span class="co"># Location of the eventual video file</span>
<span class="ot">VIDEO_FILE=</span><span class="st">&quot;./images/</span><span class="ot">$1</span><span class="st">/progress/</span><span class="ot">$2</span><span class="st">/progress.mp4&quot;</span>

<span class="co"># Use ffmpeg to create a video from the images in &quot;images/$1/progress/$2/&quot;</span>
<span class="co"># in sequential order</span>
<span class="kw">ffmpeg</span> -y -r <span class="ot">$3</span> -f image2 -s 640x640 \
  -i images/<span class="ot">$1</span>/progress/<span class="ot">$2</span>/%08d.png -b:v 1024 \
  -vcodec libx264 -crf 25 -pix_fmt yuv420p <span class="ot">$VIDEO_FILE</span>

<span class="co"># Remove intermediate frames after video has been rendered</span>
<span class="kw">rm</span> ./images/<span class="ot">$1</span>/progress/<span class="ot">$2</span>/*.png

<span class="co"># Open the video file after it has completed rendering.</span>
<span class="kw">xdg-open</span> <span class="ot">$VIDEO_FILE</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This script is called with the appropriate arguments from within the image rendering program if the <code>--render-video</code> option is supplied. I use a hard-coded frame rate of 30 frames per second within the application, but occasionally I will override that, so it is useful to retain as a command line flag. <code>ffmpeg</code> is largely a mystery to me, so a lot of these options have been picked up after troubleshooting and completely forgotten about after I got it working.</p>
<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h3>
<p>These things have saved me a lot of time and pain with a bit of fiddling around. Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/BendotK">ping me on twitter</a> if you have any questions or comments. 🍻</p>
